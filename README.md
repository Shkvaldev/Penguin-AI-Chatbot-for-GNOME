# Getting Started with Anthropic API

1. Sign up for an [Anthropic account](https://console.anthropic.com/)

2. Go to [API Keys](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys) in your Anthropic Console

3. Click on "Create Key" to generate a new API key

4. Copy your new API key

5. Open the extension settings window and paste your key (make sure to first delete the default 'Input your key here' text)

That's it! The extension is now ready to use with Claude. By default, it uses the `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` model, which offers an excellent balance of capabilities and performance. If you want to use a different Claude model, you can find the complete list of available models in the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview).
